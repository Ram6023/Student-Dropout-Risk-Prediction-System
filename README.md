## 🏛️ Project Overview
This initiative was developed under the **Centre of Excellence (COE)** program as a mission-critical tool for academic institutions. **DropoutAI** leverages a multi-vector heuristic machine learning model to proactively identify students at risk of attrition, enabling institutions to implement targeted intervention strategies before dropout occurs.

Our platform transforms raw academic and financial data into a **Premium Intelligence Dashboard**, providing administrators with a clear, actionable diagnostic of their student body's health.

## ✨ Enterprise Features

- **🚀 Neural Risk Forecasting**: Real-time diagnostic engine generating accurate dropout probability scores.
- **📊 360° Analytical Dashboard**: A high-end visualization suite for monitoring cohort trends, critical alerts, and attendance metrics.
- **🔍 Diagnostic Vector Analysis**: Deep-dive assessment across four critical success pillars (Attendance, Pre-requisite CGPA, Financial Compliance).
- **📥 Unified Data Ingestion**: Secure mass-processing support for institutional CSV records to analyze entire departments in seconds.
- **💎 Glassmorphism 2.0 UI**: An elite, dark-mode administrative interface powered by Framer Motion, featuring progressive blur headers and adaptive layouts.
- **💡 Automated Intervention Protocols**: Intelligent, context-aware recommendations generated based on specific risk signatures.

## 🛠️ Technological Infrastructure

### **Frontend & Visual Systems**
- **Core**: React 18 + Vite (optimized for sub-second page loads).
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation across all data interfaces.
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS v4 featuring ultra-modern utility-first styling.
- **Motion**: Framer Motion for high-fidelity micro-interactions and transitions.

### **Backend & Intelligence Layer**
- **Framework**: FastAPI (High-performance asynchronous Python REST API).
- **Core Model**: Weighted Sigmoid Regression Heuristic (Proprietary weights optimized for educational datasets).
- **Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for high-concurrency data manipulation.
- **Integrity**: Pydantic for rigid schema enforcement and validation.
